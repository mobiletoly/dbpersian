{"name":"DBPersian","tagline":"Database Persistence Annotations for Android","body":"### DBPersian - Database Persistence Annotations for Android\r\nDBPersian is a simple and elegant framework to help you to deal with a routine tasks such as database access. This is a pretty thin layer in between SQLite database and Android application, mostly designed to provide a convenient way to serialize/deserialize entities to/from SQLite database based on Java annotations. The primary goal is to keep developer as close to the database as possible while getting rid of some burden and boilerplate code. Also performance is a key consideration for DBPersian, so no reflections and other relatively slow approaches, everything is done via generating code in compile time, so hopefully your code will be as fast as if you would write it by yourself.\r\n\r\nAlright, let's get down to business. The following tutorial assumes that you are using Android Studio with gradle for your development. We are going to write a simple Music Collection application, that will help you to start using DBPersian and will show you a best practices at the same time. We are going to use a step-by-step approach.\r\n\r\nYou can create a new Android project or just simply take a look at [demo code](https://github.com/mobiletoly/dbpersian/tree/master/android/TestApp) repository which we have tried to keep as simple as possible.\r\n\r\nAt first let's take a look how is gradle file looks like\r\n\r\n    ...\r\n    // We need APT plugin to perform compile-time annotations processing\r\n    buildscript {\r\n        repositories {\r\n            mavenCentral()\r\n        }\r\n        dependencies {\r\n            // --- DBPersian uses APT (annotation processor), so this plugin is required\r\n            classpath 'com.neenbedankt.gradle.plugins:android-apt:1.4'\r\n        }\r\n        ...\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    apply plugin: 'com.android.application'\r\n    // --- Apply APT plugin\r\n    apply plugin: 'com.neenbedankt.android-apt'\r\n\r\n    android {\r\n        ...\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    \r\n    dependencies {\r\n        repositories {\r\n            ...\r\n            mavenCentral()\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        compile fileTree(dir: 'libs', include: ['*.jar'])\r\n\r\n        // --- Add dbpersian dependencies\r\n        compile 'net.dbpersian:api:0.5'\r\n        provided 'net.dbpersian:builder:0.5'\r\n        apt 'net.dbpersian:builder:0.5'\r\n   }\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
